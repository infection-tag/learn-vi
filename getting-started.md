Now that you have VI installed, let's get into the basics.

# Why use VIM?

VI is a text editor that has been around since the '90s. Ist stands for VIsual.

As of this writing, we live in the second decade of the twenty-first century. When thinking about coding and editing text, we don't think about VI very much, if at all. There are plenty of softwares out there, IDEs (integrated development environments) and word processors that do what we need. But the time comes when we realize that those things are overkill -- and all we need is a terminal and this app to get where we need to be.

Sometimes, we find ourselves temporarily working on another computer. Because VI comes installed by default on many different operating systems, it helps to know how to use it.

# Launching VI

To launch vi, simply open your command line and type

```
vi <file-name>
```

If you want to launch gvim or macvim, both of which have a nice graphical interface, type

```
gvim <file-name>
```

(yes, this launches macvim on MacOS as well).

# The basics of VI

Let's get started with vi. On your terminal, type:

```
cd ~
mkdir vim-practice
cd vim-practice
vi test
```
